<header><h2>Why I Love Jehovah My God And How I Can Show It</h2></header>
<p>JEHOVAH has invited us to join his family of worshippers. What a marvelous invitation that is! Our family is made up of those who have dedicated themselves to God and who exercise faith in the ransom sacrifice of his Son. Ours is a happy family. We enjoy a meaningful life now, and we rejoice in the prospect of life without end​—whether in heaven or in Paradise on earth.</p>

<p>Moved by love and at great cost to himself, Jehovah opened the way for us to be part of his family. We were “bought with a price.” By means of the ransom, Jehovah made it possible for us to have a warm relationship with him. We have the honor of addressing the greatest Person in the universe as Father. And, as we considered in the preceding article, Jehovah is the ideal Father.<p>
