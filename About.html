<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>I got my first intrest in coding from loving to put things together. Let me explain. So, I used to play with Legos and I loved making things. As I grew up I was trusted with a computer. I loved playing video games. Like most of you boys out there, I was the best at them. However, there were a few things in the game that I wanted to add or get rid of. So I did what most kids do and I downloaded mods.</p>
<br>
<p>So, I played with these mods and soon I wondered how in the world do they work. The thought of coding came in my head. So I went in the game files and saw these files in the game. I tried to edit every single one. None opened for editing. I did find files with the extension - .json - I tried to edit these in WordPad. It worked! I looked over the code and saw the structure in it. I did my best to change some of the things. I opened the game and tried it and it worked.</p>
<br>
<p>When I got into High School, I had a class that was all about technology. I was glad that html coding is somthing I had to learn. I looked at a few tutorials and I got this here. I used notepad and notepad++ to do this. It is very easy.</p>
<p>Almost everyday I update this website. If you have a idea for me then go to <a class="contact-about" href="ContactUs.html"><strong>Contact Us.</strong></a></p>
<p>I think I need this page to scroll so I'm just adding more text to it.</p>
<p><strong>The scrollbar is there just to be there.</strong></p>
